    <br>
    <hr>
    <h3>Kingsman: the secret service</h3>
    <p>Kingsman:the secret service is a spy movie about Eggsy, a poor man who lives with his mom, newborn sister and his abusive stepfather. <br> 
        After stealing a car Eggsy gets contacted by Harry Hert, a spy who recruits him to become a Kingsman, a gentleman's spy. <br> 
        At the same time is the eccentric miljoner Valentine preparing to restart humanity with a new superweapon <br>
     The movie is one of my favorite. It is in many ways a British spy film but makes itself uniq with its blend of jokes, action and over the top violence 
    </p>
    <h3>The Captain</h3>
    <p>Willi Herold is a german Fallschirmj√§ger. After deserting in 1945 he finds a empty car by the road side. Inside there is only some apples and a briefcase with a Luftwaffe captain uniform. <br>
         Soon Herold will travel around in the crumbling third reich with a band of deserters with the mission to survive the war. <br>
    The movie is a blend of a serious war movie showing the horrors of the pow camps in nazi germany and a crazy comedy where one man does worse and worse things to not be find out and to have fun</p>
    <h3>Generation war</h3>
    <p>The german invasion of the soviet union is on its way to start and five friends is having a party in a bar in Berlin. <br>
        Wilhelm Winter is a german officer. His brother Friedhelm Winter is a soldier in Wilhelms company. Charlotte have just graduated as a field nurse for the army. <br>
        Greta is a bartender but has ambitions of becoming a star in Berlins music industry while her boyfriend Victor is a jew and apprentice in his fathers tailor shop. <br>
        Five friends, five stories, one war. <br>
    This mini series is in many ways a perfect depiction of the eastern front in world war two. This series shows how optimistic the germans was in the begining of the war but slowly the reality of war breaks their spirits. <br>
     War is hell and no movie shows it as well as this series.</p>
